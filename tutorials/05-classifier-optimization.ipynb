    "# Classifier Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In earlier notebooks, we explored classification and feature selection techniques. Throughout, we have emphasized the importance of using cross-validation to measure classifier performance and to perform feature selection. We introduced the [Pipeline package](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/pipeline.html#pipeline) to help facilitate this cross-validation process. During the past exercises we didn't pay much attention to the parameters of the classifier and set them arbitrarily or based on intuition. Biased selection measures are problematic and can lead to circular inferences (aka [double dipping](http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nn.2303)). In what follows we are going to investigate data-driven, unbiased techniques to optimize classification parameters such as choice of classifiers, cost parameters and classification penalties. We will again use the pipeline package to perform this optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the useful features from scikit-learn to perform cross-validation. scikit-learn also offers a simple procedure for building and automating the various steps involved in classifier optimization (e.g. data scaling => feature selection => parameter tuning). We will also explore these methods in this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal of this script\n",
    "1. Learn to detect circularity, and avoid it.\n",
    "2. Build a pipeline of steps to optimize classifier performance.    \n",
    "3. Use the pipeline to make an optimal classifier.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recap:** The localizer data we are working with ([Kim et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3272-16.2017)) consists of 3 runs with 5 blocks for each category. In the matlab stimulus file, the first row has the stimulus labels for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd runs of the localizer. Each run was 310 TRs.\n",
    "The 4th row contains the time when the stimulus was presented for each of the runs. The stimulus labels and their corresponding categories are as follows: 1 = Faces, 2 = Scenes, 3 = Objects\n",

    "**Dataset:** For this script we will use a localizer dataset from [Kim et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3272-16.2017) again. Just to recap: The localizer consisted of 3 runs with 5 blocks of each category (faces, scenes and objects) per run. Each block was presented for 15s. Within a block, a stimulus was presented every 1.5s (1 TR). Between blocks, there was 15s (10 TRs) of fixation. Each run was 310 TRs. In the matlab stimulus file, the first row codes for the stimulus category for each trial (1 = Faces, 2 = Scenes, 3 = Objects).

For example, if you only have one run, it can still be useful to z-score each voxel (over time) within that run. Without z-scoring, voxels may have wildly different scales due to scanner drift or other confounds, distorting the classifier. Hence we need to normalize within run but this could be considered double dipping because each run includes both training and test data.

A grid search would involve changing the value of each parameter with respect to the other in some fixed step size (e.g., 60 degrees and 50% humidity, 60 degrees and 60% humidity, 65 degrees and 60% humidity, etc.) and evaluating your preference for each combination.  \n",

    "### 3.2 Regularization Example: L2 vs. L1 <a id=\"reg\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization is a technique that helps to reduce overfitting by assigning a penalty to the weights formed by the model. One common classifier used is [logistic regression](https://towardsdatascience.com/logistic-regression-detailed-overview-46c4da4303bc). There are different regularization options for logistic regression, such as the L1 vs. L2 penalty. An L1 penalty penalizes the sum of the absolute values of the weights whereas an L2 (also called Euclidean) penalty penalizes the sum of the squares of the weights. The L1 penalty leads to a sparser set of weights, with some high and the rest close to zero. The L2 penalty results in weights having very small values. A more detailed explanation of (L2 and L1) regularization can be found [here](http://enhancedatascience.com/2017/07/04/machine-learning-explained-regularization/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we compare the L1 and L2 penalty for logistic regression. For each of the penalty types, we run 3 folds and compute the correlation of weights across folds. If the weights on each voxel are similar across folds then that can be thought of as a stable model. A higher correlation means a more stable model. L1 penalties can result in better performance on any given fold, but the weights are less stable across folds compared to L2. \n"

    "\n",
    "When we are writing a classification pipeline, nested cross validation can be very useful. As the name suggests, this procedure nests a second cross-validation within folds of the first cross validation. As before, we will divide data into training and test sets (outer loop), but additionally will divide the training set itself in order to set the hyper-parameters into training and validation sets (inner loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, on each split we now have a training (inner), validation (inner), and test (outer) dataset; we will use leave-one-run-out for the validation set in the inner loop. Within the inner loop we train the model and find the optimal hyper-parameters (i.e., that have the highest performance when tested on the validation data). The typical practice is to then retrain your model with these hyper-parameters on both the training AND validation datasets and then evaluate on your held-out test dataset to get a score.\n",
