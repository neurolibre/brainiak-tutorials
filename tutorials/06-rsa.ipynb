    "# Representational Similarity Analysis\n",

    "\n",
    "Oranges and orange ping-pong balls are not kept next to each other in the grocery store. The oranges are usually placed with other fruits and ping-pong balls with other sport equipment. This helps us shop easily, as we usually group our shopping by categories: fruits and vegetables, meat and dairy, frozen foods, and, somewhere far away, kitchen supplies, toys and sports. Beyond grocery stores, are these meaningful conceptual groupings in the brain? Are patterns of neural activity for oranges and apples more similar to each other as compared to the patterns for oranges and ping-pong balls?\n",
    "\n",
    "One could conceivably group items based on other attributes such as shape and color. This would make the neural representations of oranges and orange colored ping-pong balls very similar to each other. In a brain region that cares about color, the neural similarity would be greater for oranges and orange ping-pong balls, compared to oranges and red apples. How can we determine the similarity between neural representations and which attributes are driving this similarity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Representational similarity analysis (RSA) is a way to compare and contrast different brain states and the stimuli that elicited them. In RSA, we compute a similarity measure (often a correlation) between patterns of neural activity for all items being compared. Then, to examine whether neural patterns in a brain region are grouped by color, shape, or category, we can order the similarity measure based on a model that groups by these attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "RSA is a highly versatile tool: it can be used to compare brain activity to models, compare data across brain imaging techniques, and even to make cross-species comparisons. You can learn more about the RSA method [here](https://doi.org/10.3389/neuro.06.004.2008) and [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2013.06.007).\n",
